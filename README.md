# Azure MVC App running in Docker on Azure using an Azure SQL Server

The goal of this project was to get a simple app with CRUD Operations to run entirely on Azure inside a container for continuous deployment.
I used a container registry for Docker on Azure, an Azure SQL server, and hosted it as an Azure Web App.

The app itself is mostly a typical MVC C# app, but I've added some styling with bootstrap.

I'm going to turn the app off and delete the server so I don't rack up a charge on Azure, but here is a video of the app working:
